      <h3> <u>Steps On How To Play <i>Daruma-san</i></u> &#8595;</h3>
   </div>
   <ol class="steps">
      <div class="stepsbox">
         <li> Begin at night.</h3> 
         <li> Fill up the bathtub with water and switch off the lights.</li>
         <li> Take off all your clothes and sit in the bathtub. Ensuring you are facing the faucet and taps of the bathtub.</li>
         <li> Close your eyes and begin washing your hair.</li>
         <li> As you wash your hair, repeat the phrase "Daruma-San fell down. Daruma-San fell down.". Don't stop repeating those words until you have finished washing your hair. Don't open your eyes throughout the process.</li>
         <li> If you have followed the instructions properly, you will have a mental image of a Japanese women standing in the bathtub. She will slip and fall, landing on a rusty tap and gouging her right eye out.</li>
         <li> If you were to hear any noise behind you or feel any movement in the tub, <b><big>*do NOT turn around and do NOT open your eyes*</big></b>. you may simply ask, " Why did you fall?".</li>
         <li> You may allow the question to hang in the air, keep your eyes shut and slowly and carefully get out of the tub and do not drain the tub. Exit yourself from the bathroom, closing the door behind you.</li>
         <li> Go to sleep.</li>

         <h3> 1. The game will begin once you awaken from your sleep.</h3>
         <h3> 2. Go about your day as usual, but on this specific day you will feel a constant presence following you. You may capture a glimpse of <i>her</i> on occasion as you glance over your right shoulder. She will have black-tangled hair, and she will only have one eye. </h3>
         <h3> 3. <i>She</i> will attempt to get closer to you throughout the day. If she was to get too close, shout "tomare!" it means "stop", and run away. This is to ensure that there is a good distance between you and her, whatever you do, DO NOT allow her to catch you.</h3>

      <div class="addbox">
         <ul>
            <li><i>She</i> is fond of water and dark space. Therefore, it is recommended that you avoid any of those place until the game has ended.</li>
            <li> The "Tomare!" does diminish everytime you use it, thus, use it sparringly.</li>
            <li> The ending MUST be done before midnight. Failing to do so will grant her permission to enter your dreams. </li>
