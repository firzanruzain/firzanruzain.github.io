            Hide and Seek Alone: Hitori Kakurenbo is a famous game in Japan and Korea, originating from Japan where you let a spirit/demon possess a doll and then play a game of "hide and seek" with them. The "game" is necromancy, it is potentially very dangerous, and is not good for your sanity. Do NOT try this game just because you're curious or want to experience it for yourself, this is a very dangerous life-risking game.<br><br>
            NOTE: It's best to put your pets outside of your house. There have been reports of dogs barking and cats hissing at nothing. Some even reported their pets behaving strangely after the game.

Sew the doll back again with red thread, and wrap the remaining red string around the whole doll. This is important as it binds the spirit.

It is recommended to have a cellphone on silent mode and brightness on the lowest level in case of emergencies.

            Ending the ritual is very important as this will end the game as well.
            <br>
            To end the ritual, get out of your hiding spot, find the doll (it may not be in the bathroom), and then drink the saltwater. Pour the remaining saltwater around the doll in a circle as well. Close your eyes and shout out "I win!" three times, the spirit in the doll will give up and the game ends. You MUST dispose of the doll by burying it with salt, otherwise the spirit will attempt to re-enter the doll. Some versions say to put salt in every corner of your house after you bury the doll especially where the doll has been found as salt drives away most malevolent spirits.
