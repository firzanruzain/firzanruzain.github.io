<hr width =“640” size =10> 

<p style = "color:red;background-color:#27571F;font-family:Chiller;font-size:30px"> <b> Bloody Mary </b> was the <u>first-ever Queen of England</u> to rule in her own right, but to her critics, <u> Mary I of England </u> has long been known only as <b>"Bloody Mary" </b> </p>

<p style = "color:red;background-color:#27571F;font-family:Chiller;font-size:30px"> This unfortunate nickname was <b> thanks to her persecution of Protestant heretics </b>, whom she burned at the stake in the hundreds. She was the <u> bloodthirsty religious fanatic </u> that posterity has bequeathed to us. While hundreds died under Mary’s reign, her dark legacy may have as much to do with the fact that she was a Catholic monarch succeeded by a <mark style = "color:#420C09;background-color:purple"> Protestant Queen </mark> in a country that remained Protestant. </p>

<p style = "color:red;background-color:#27571F;font-family:Chiller;font-size:30px"> During her five-year reign, Mary had <u> over 300 religious dissenters </u> burned at the stake in what are known as <mark style = "color:#420C09;background-color:purple"> the Marian persecutions </mark> . It is a statistic which seems barbaric. But her own father, <mark style = "color:#420C09;background-color:purple"> Henry VIII </mark> , executed 81 people for heresy. And her half-sister, <u> Elizabeth I </u> , also executed scores of people for their faith. </p>
